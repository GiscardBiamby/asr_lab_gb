# This repo is for my submission to the EE225D Lab

## The three experiment results are in the notebooks:

ASR_Lab-Giscard_Biamby.ipynb
ASR_Lab-Giscard_Biamby_10min.ipynb
ASR_Lab-Giscard_Biamby_05min.ipynb

## Dataset / Corpus

I used https://dictate.app to collect the audio. This tool collects data at 8khz, so if I were to do this again I would use another tool. 

The utterances came from two different chapters of Michael Lewis' book, "The New New Thing."

I collected 600 audio samples, and split this into train/val/test splits (80%/10%/10%).
